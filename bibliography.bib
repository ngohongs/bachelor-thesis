    abstract = {Animating fluids like water, smoke, and fire by physics-based simulation is increasingly important in visual effects and is starting to make an impact in real-time games. This course goes from the basics of 3D fluid flow to the state of the art in graphics. We will begin with an intuitive explanation of the important concepts in fluid simulation, and as we progress demonstrate how to implement an effective smoke and water simulation system, complete with irregular curved boundaries and surface tension. The last half of the course will cover advanced topics such as fire and explosions, adaptive grid methods, real-time-capable algorithms together with the latest technology in hardware acceleration, and non-Newtonian fluids like sand. Intuition and implementation details will be underscored throughout.},

  abstract = {We present a novel method for solid/fluid coupling that can treat infinitesimally thin solids modeled by a lower dimensional triangulated surface. Since classical solid/fluid coupling algorithms rasterize the solid body onto the fluid grid, an entirely new approach is required to treat thin objects that do not contain an interior region. Robust ray casting is used to augment a number of interpolation, finite difference and rendering techniques so that fluid does not leak through the triangulated surface. Moreover, we propose a technique for properly enforcing incompressibility so that fluid does not incorrectly compress (and appear to lose mass) near the triangulated surface. This allows for the robust interaction of cloth and shells with thin sheets of water. The proposed method works for both rigid body shells and for deformable manifolds such as cloth, and we present a two way coupling technique that allows the fluid's pressure to affect the solid. Examples illustrate that our method performs well, especially in the difficult case of water and cloth where it produces visually rich interactions between the particle level set method for treating the water/air interface and our newly proposed method for treating the solid/fluid interface. We have implemented the method on both uniform and adaptive octree grids.},

    abstract = {A ray-tracing procedural model is described, in which ocean waves and islands are rendered by different but related algorithms. The algorithms are based on analytic formulas involving arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and square roots, and are organized for a vectorizing compiler on a Cray 1, a “supercomputer” with a vector pipeline architecture. Height field methods are used, one vertical scan line at a time, to trace the direct rays to the ocean, where they are reflected. Approximate methods are then applied to find whether the reflected rays meet any other object on their way to the sky. The output, at eight bits per pixel, gives information for shading, e.g. the angle of the surface normal for rays meeting the islands, or the angle of elevation from the horizon for rays continuing unobstructed to the sky.The output is recorded on a magnetic tape for each frame in one cycle of the wave motion, and plotted offline on a Dicomed D-48 color film recorder. The eight bits per pixel are interpreted by a color translation table, which is gradually changed as the wave cycle is repeated to simulate the changing illumination during sunset.},

  abstract = {We present a simple model for the surface of the ocean, suitable for the modeling and rendering of most common waves where the disturbing force is from the wind and the restoring force from gravity.It is based on the Gerstner, or Rankine, model where particles of water describe circular or elliptical stationary orbits. The model can easily produce realistic waves shapes which are varied according to the parameters of the orbits. The surface of the ocean floor affects the refraction and the breaking of waves on the shore. The model can also determine the position, direction, and speed of breakers.The ocean surface is modeled as a parametric surface, permitting the use of traditional rendering methods, including ray-tracing and adaptive subdivision. Animation is easy, since time is built into the model. The foam generated by the breakers is modeled by particle systems whose direction, speed and life expectancy is given by the surface model.To give designers control over the shape of the ocean, the model of the overall surface includes multiple trains of waves, each with its own set of parameters and optional stochastic elements. The overall "randomness" and "short-crestedness" of the ocean is achieved by a combination of small variations within a train and large variations between trains.Rendered examples of oceans waves generated by the model are given and a 10 second animation is described.},

  abstract = {Realistically animated fluids can add substantial realism to interactive applications such as virtual surgery simulators or computer games. In this paper we propose an interactive method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate fluids with free surfaces. The method is an extension of the SPH-based technique by Desbrun to animate highly deformable bodies. We gear the method towards fluid simulation by deriving the force density fields directly from the Navier-Stokes equation and by adding a term to model surface tension effects. In contrast to Eulerian grid-based approaches, the particle-based approach makes mass conservation equations and convection terms dispensable which reduces the complexity of the simulation. In addition, the particles can directly be used to render the surface of the fluid. We propose methods to track and visualize the free surface using point splatting and marching cubes-based surface reconstruction. Our animation method is fast enough to be used in interactive systems and to allow for user interaction with models consisting of up to 5000 particles.},

This paper describes a point rendering and texture filtering technique called surface splatting which directly renders opaque and transparent surfaces from point clouds without connectivity. It is based on a novel screen space formulation of the Elliptical Weighted Average (EWA) filter. Our rigorous mathematical analysis extends the texture resampling framework of Heckbert to irregularly spaced point samples. To render the points, we develop a surface splat primitive that implements the screen space EWA filter. Moreover, we show how to optimally sample image and procedural textures to irregular point data during pre-processing. We also compare the optimal algorithm with a more efficient view-independent EWA pre-filter. Surface splatting makes the benefits of EWA texture filtering available to point-based rendering. It provides high quality anisotropic texture filtering, hidden surface removal, edge anti-aliasing, and order-independent transparency.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel framework for acceleration of 3D model-based, markerless visual tracking in multi-camera videos is proposed. The objective function being the most computationally demanding part of model-based 3D motion reconstruction is calculated on a GPU. The proposed framework effectively utilizes the rendering power of OpenGL to render the 3D models in the predicted poses, whereas the CUDA threads are used to match such rendered models with the image observations and to perform particle swarm optimization-based tracking. We demonstrate effective parallelization of the particle swarm optimization on GPU. Execution of time-consuming parts of the algorithm on GPU using CUDA-OpenGL significantly accelerates the 3D motion reconstruction, making our method capable of tracking full-body movements with a maximum speed of 15 fps. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results on various four-camera benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method for real-time motion tracking.},
